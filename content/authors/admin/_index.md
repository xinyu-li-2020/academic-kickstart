I am first year PhD student at in Industrial Engineering & Operations Research at UC Berkeley. My primary research interests are a combination of optimization theory, statistics, and rigorous stochastic analysis. 

Prior to joining UC Berkely, I finished my undergrad at New York University Shanghai and Courant Institute, with major in Honors Mathematics and minor in Data Science.

I am passionate about working in many areas including optimization and stochastics, combining probability theory with theoretical optimization theory, and developing optimization tools which can be used in a high-dimensional and stochastic system. I am interested in data-driven optimization, convex and non-convex optimization, high-dimensional statistics, stochastic optimization, optimal control theory, mean-field game and control theory.
